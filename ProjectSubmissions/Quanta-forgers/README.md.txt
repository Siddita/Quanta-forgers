 Quantum-Enhanced Newton-Raphson Method

This project implements a quantum-enhanced version of the Newton-Raphson method for root-finding using **Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The algorithm estimates the derivative of a function using quantum computing and blends it with a classical analytical approach for stability.

 Features

- Uses Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to estimate derivatives.
- Implements Newton-Raphson root-finding with quantum and analytical derivatives.
- Includes **oscillation detection** and stabilization techniques.

 Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the dependencies using:
